              Mori Ōgai, (born February 17, 1862, Tsuwano, Japan—died July 9, 1922, Tokyo), one of the creators of modern Japanese literature.
              The son of a physician of the aristocratic warrior (samurai) class, Mori Ōgai studied medicine, at first in Tokyo and from 1884
              to 1888 in Germany. In 1890 he published the story “Maihime” (“The Dancing Girl”), an account closely based on his own experience
              of an unhappy attachment between a German girl and a Japanese student in Berlin. It represented a marked departure from the 
              impersonal fiction of preceding generations and initiated a vogue for autobiographical revelations among Japanese writers. Ōgai’s 
              most popular novel, Gan (1911–13; part translation: The Wild Goose), is the story of the undeclared love of a moneylender’s 
              mistress for a medical student who passes by her house each day. Ōgai also translated Hans Christian Andersen’s autobiographical
              novel Improvisatoren.

            <p>
              After graduation, Mori enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Army as a medical officer, hoping to specialize in military medicine and 
              hygiene. He was commissioned as a deputy surgeon (lieutenant) in 1882. Mori was sent by the Army to study in Germany (Leipzig, 
              Dresden, Munich, and Berlin) from 1884 to 1888. During this time, he also developed an interest in European literature. As a matter 
              of trivia, Mori Ōgai is the first Japanese known to have ridden on the Orient Express. One of his major accomplishments was his ability 
              to create works using a style of "translation" that he obtained from his experience in European culture.

              In his stay in Germany, Ogai sometimes encountered situations where he expressed his patriotism. There was this one time that he started 
              a public controversy against a German geologist, Dr Edmund Naumann. Dr. Naumann gave a presentation entitled “Japan” at a lecture in which 
              he criticized Japan. In short, his criticism was that the opening of Japan to international relations was not a voluntary act, but was the 
              result of foreign pressure. After the lecture, Naumann was said to have made a number of jokes critical of Japan in conversation with other 
              scholars. Ogai wrote in his "Doitsu Nikki" that he made a speech to refute Naumann's comments shortly. Since it was a social occasion, the 
              controversy seemed to have been settled, but the debate was continued when Dr. Naumann published a column in the newspaper "Allgemeine Zeitung”. 
              According to "Wakaki hi no Mori Ogai" by Keiichiro Kobori, the controversy was focused on eight points including the origin of the Japanese 
              people and the treatment of the Ainu people, food and clothing, public health, manners and customs, the influence of oil painting techniques 
              on Japanese painting, Buddhism and myth, the effectiveness of the modernization movement, and the future of Japan. Of these, "the pros and cons
              of the modernization movement in Japan" and "the future of Japan" were the major points. Naumann pointed out that Japan opened its door to the 
              international relations from the external forces and had easily and superficially accepted Western civilization. Furthermore, that the Japanese 
              themselves tend to disregard the traditional culture under the justification of the modernization was his argument. Ogai made a counterargument 
              that the introduction of Western civilization was natural, rational, and spontaneous, and important point is to identify what to westernize and 
              what to preserve as traditional Japanese culture. Ogai carried out this controversy all in German.

              At the start of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, Mori was sent to Manchuria and, the following year, to Taiwan. In February 1899, he 
              was appointed head of the Army Medical Corps with the rank of surgeon major-general and was based in Kokura, Kyūshū. His transfer was because 
              of his responses to fellow doctors and his criticism about their fields of research in the Japanese Medical Journal of which he was editor. 
              In 1902, he was reassigned to Tokyo. He was attached to a division in the Russo-Japanese War, based out of Hiroshima. Although Ogai was a fine 
              artist, it is impossible to understand his thoughts on the war since he did not leave any personal document about it. This is because of his 
              position in the army.

              As an author, Mori is considered one of the leading writers of the Meiji period. In his literary journals, he instituted modern literary 
              criticism in Japan, based on the aesthetic theories of Karl von Hartmann. A house which Mori lived in is preserved in Kokurakita Ward in 
              Kitakyūshū, not far from Kokura Station. Here he wrote Kokura Nikki ("Kokura Diary"). His birthhouse is also preserved in Tsuwano. The 
              two one-story houses are remarkably similar in size and in their traditional Japanese style.

              His daughter Mari, who was nineteen years old at the time of his death, wrote extensively about her relationship with her father. 
              Starting with her 1961 novella, A Lovers' Forest (恋人たちの森, Koibito Tachi no Mori), she wrote tragic stories about love affairs 
              between older men and boys in their late teens which influenced the creation of the Yaoi genre, stories about male-male relationships, 
              written by women for women, that began to appear in the nineteen seventies in Japanese novels and comics. Mori's sister, Kimiko, 
              married Koganei Yoshikiyo. Hoshi Shinichi was one of their grandsons.

                In 1912 Ōgai was profoundly moved by the suicide of General Nogi
                Maresuke, following the death of the emperor Meiji, and he turned 
                to historical fiction depicting the samurai code. The heroes of 
                several works are warriors who, like General Nogi, commit suicide 
                in order to follow their masters to the grave. Despite his early 
                confessional writings, Ōgai came to share with his samurai heroes 
                a reluctance to dwell on emotions. His detachment made his later 
                works seem cold, but their strength and integrity were strikingly 
                close to the samurai ideals he so admired.
