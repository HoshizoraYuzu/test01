<p>"Vita Sexualis" by Ogai Mori is a significant work in Japanese literature, published in 1909 during a transformative
   period in Japan's cultural history.The novel revolves around the life of its protagonist, Shingo, and his journey of
   self-discovery in the realm of sexuality. Mori delves into the complexities of human relationships, exploring themes 
   of love, desire, and societal expectations prevalent in early 20th-century Japan. Shingo's experiences serve as a lens 
   through which Mori examines the psychological and philosophical dimensions of intimate connections, challenging 
   established norms and moral values. The novel not only portrays an individual's sexual awakening but also provides a 
   broader commentary on the societal shifts and intellectual discourse of the time. Mori's exploration of these themes, 
   coupled with his intricate narrative style, has cemented "Vita Sexualis" as a classic in Japanese literature, offering 
   readers a profound and thought-provoking reflection on the human condition.

   "The Dancing Girl" (舞姫, Maihime) was the first published short story by the Japanese writer Mori Ōgai. 
   The story first appeared in Kokumin no Tomo (People's Friend, 国民之友) in 1890, and is based on Mori's 
   own experiences as a medical student in Germany. In some ways, this tale foreshadows Puccini's Madama 
   Butterfly, which deals with a similar theme but with a slight role reversal: in Madama Butterfly, a 
   Western man abandons a Japanese woman, while in The Dancing Girl a Japanese man leaves a Western woman.
   The short story was adapted into an episode of Animated Classics of Japanese Literature, which was released 
   in North America by Central Park Media. It was also adapted into an OVA (Original Video Animation) by Toei 
   Animation in 2006.

   "Suimatsu (Minawa) Shū," 130 years ago in 1892 (Meiji 25), when he was 30 years old. This large volume, compiled
   by Ōgai himself, contains over 600 pages and includes his novel trilogy "Maihime" (Dancing Girl), "Utakata no Ki" 
   (Memories of a Utakata), and "Bunzukahi," as well as 14 translated novels, 2 translated plays, and a collection of 
   translated poems titled "Omokage," which he co-translated with friends. It can be said that this comprehensive 
   collection represents Ōgai's poetic ideas and literary ambitions of his twenties. The "Suimatsu Shū" was not only 
   a special volume for Ōgai but also a book that was read and cherished for a long time. Over the years, the "Suimatsu
   Shū" underwent several editions and abridged versions were published until Ōgai's death at the age of 60. With each 
   edition, Ōgai meticulously revised the content, wrote new prefaces and Chinese poems, and made corrections to the text.
   The main focus of this exhibition is this singular volume. Through the history of its publication, Ōgai's activities at 
   the time, and the works included, we will explore what Ōgai attempted with the "Suimatsu Shū." Additionally, we will 
   introduce literary figures who were influenced by the "Suimatsu Shū." We invite you to experience the emotions Mori Ōgai
   poured into his first collection of works.

  <p>
    To enjoy unique, utterly exquisite Venice, allow a few days. Glide
    down the Grand Canal, by gondola or vaporetto (water bus), tour the
    grand Palazzo Ducale, gape at the treasure-filled Basilica di San
    Marco and run out of camera space snapping the extraordinary array
    of Venetian architecture. There'll also be time to join the locals
    shopping at Rialto Market, tuck into cicheti (Venetian tapas) and
    get a little lost amid the 400 bridges and 150 canals.
