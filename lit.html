            Although Mori did little writing from 1892 to 1902, he continued to edit a 
            literary journal (Mezamashi gusa, 1892–1909). He also produced translations 
            of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Ibsen, Hans Christian Andersen, and Hauptmann. 
            It was during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) that Mori started keeping a poetic 
            diary. After the war, he began holding tanka writing parties that included several 
            noted poets such as Yosano Akiko. Mori Ōgai helped found a new magazine called 
            Subaru (literary magazine) in 1909 with the help of others such as Yosano Akiko 
            and Yosano Tekkan. His later works can be divided into three separate periods. From 
            1909 to 1912, he wrote mostly fiction based on his own experiences. This period 
            includes Vita Sexualis and his most popular novel, Gan (雁, The Wild Geese, 1911–13), 
            which is set in 1881 Tokyo and was filmed by Shirō Toyoda in 1953 as The Mistress.

            In 1909, he released his novel Vita Sexualis, which was abruptly banned 
            a month later. Authorities deemed his work too sexual and dangerous to 
            public morals. Mori Ōgai, during the period he was writing Vita Sexualis, 
            focused on making a statement regarding the current literary trends of 
            modern Japanese literature. He approached the trend on sexuality and 
            individualism by describing them as a link between body and soul. 
            Ōgai points out problems concerning the art and literature world in 
            the 19th century in his work. His writing style, depicted from the Meiji 
            government's perspective, derived from naturalism and was implemented with 
            his thoughts that were brought up from writers who focused on the truth. 
            Ogai expressed his concern towards the intellectual freedom after High 
            Treason Incident in 1910 where socialists and anarchists were unfairly 
            executed by the court on suspicion of the assassination of the Japanese 
            Emperor Meiji. Although he was on the side of the government as an elite 
            army doctor, Ogai showed strong concern about the government's suppression 
            of thought and academics, and started to call for freedom of speech. His 
            arguments were embedded in some of his works such as “Chinmoku no to” 
            and “Shokudo”.

            His later works link his concerns with the Ministry of Education regarding 
            the understanding of "intellectual freedom" and how they police and dictate 
            the potential of literature. During the time from 1912 to 1916 saw a shift 
            in his writing work from fictions to historical stories, influenced by the 
            shocking news of Nogi Maresukea’s death, a general of the Imperial Japanese 
            Army. In this event, Ōgai saw a revival of pre-modern ritual in the world 
            where the individualism was gradually stemming. While the public opinion 
            quickly labeled Nogi’s death as anachronistic, Ōgai, who was closer to Nogi, 
            started the investigation of the spiritual background of his age by narrating 
            the biographies of the past events. The works such as ‘Abe Ichizoku’ and ‘Shibue 
            Chusai’ were the byproducts of his approach to the Japanese history. In these 
            historical biographies, Ōgai depicted the men who committed ritual death, Junshi 
            with a realistic prose. Through these works, Ōgai realized that those people who 
            had to die were, to a certain extent, victims of the long-held practice and social 
            expectation. Why Ōgai was inclined to investigate the history, or in other word, 
            the identity of Japan, was partially because of his personal matter in which he 
            was struggling to take a balance between West and East. Another reason was that he 
            wanted to look back at the Meiji era at the very last time. After "Yasui Fujin" in 
            1914, his style changed from "history as it is," in which he depicted history as 
            it had been narrated, to "story based on history," in which he somehow added his 
            own arrangements to historical events. Followed by this change, “Shibue Chusai”, 
            one of his best known works, was come off. From 1916 to 1921, he turned his attention 
            to biographies of three Edo period doctors.

            To elaborate on one of Ōgai’s earlier works, Dancing Girl (舞姫) was a story chronicling 
            the love affair of a Japanese prodigy, Toyotarō, with an uneducated German woman Elis. 
            During this affair, Elis gets pregnant, and he leaves her to return to Japan. Toyotarō 
            spends much of his tale being torn between the life he leads in Germany with his new love, 
            while being is pulled back to Japan by his job and family. He also spends a reasonable amount 
            of time pondering his education, and the kind of a person it turned him into. His decision to 
            leave her was instigated by his Japanese friend Aizawa, and the news drove Elis into madness, 
            but despite this, Toyotarō was grateful for his friend’s meddling.[11] Throughout the time that 
            Dancing Girl was written, following the fall of the Tokugawa Period and the beginning of the 
            Meiji Restoration, an isolationist mindset was a common theme amongst other authors (such as 
            Natsume Soseki, Junichiro Tanizaki, etc.). The drastic culture shift influenced a lot of authors 
            to focus their individuality and feelings of isolation into their works through their principle 
            characters. In Dancing Girl in particular, the traditionalism of Tokugawa Japan and familial duty 
            is pulling Toyotaro back, while the Meiji Japan that encouraged international knowledge and duty 
            to that Japan is keeping him there.

            Sansho Dayu was an early Japanese work written in the mid 1600's, and Ogai's rewrite of it essentially 
            changed some minor details and the ending, wherein which the bailiff's punishment is not given as much 
            attention as in the original, and it is not so much violent as it is politically appropriate. There are 
            also numerous supernatural elements removed from the original story, making it palatable to a wider 
            audience. Ogai's retelling of Sansho Dayu was made into a film, directed by Kenji Mizoguchi (1954).
